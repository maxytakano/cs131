Testing function calls returning FLOAT
 1. foo1() - returning 1 as literal
 2. foo1() -  received 1.00
 3. foo2() - returning 2 as local
 4. foo2() -  received 2.00
 5. foo3() - returning 3 as const local
 6. foo3() -  received 3.00
 7. foo4() - returning 4 as global
 8. foo4() -  received 4.00
 9. bar1() - returning 5 as direct
10. bar2() - returning 5
11. bar1() -  received 5.00
12. foo5() - recursive start
13. foo5() - returning 1
14. foo5() - returning 2.00
15. foo5() - returning 3.00
16. foo5() - returning 4.00
17. foo5() - returning 5.00
18. foo5() - recursive end - final value: 5.00
All 1.00 for recursive returns is correct until float arithmatic works
